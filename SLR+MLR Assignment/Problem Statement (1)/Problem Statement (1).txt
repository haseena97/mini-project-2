1) Calories_consumed-> predict weight gained using calories consumed
observation: weight gained dataset skewed to the right
SLR~ R squared=0.897
log calories~ R squared=0.808
log gain~ R squared=0.878
2) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time 
3) Emp_data -> Build a prediction model for Churn_out_rate 
4) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike

Do the necessary transformations for input variables for getting better R^2 value for the models prepared.
