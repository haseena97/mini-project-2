Q. Prepare a classification model using SVM for salary data.

Answered:
Linear kernel is used because output is binary classification

Observation:
SVC is taking too much time to train data ( more than 15 minutes). 

Feature scaling is essential for machine learning algorithms that calculate distances between data, such as SVM.
After feature scaling have been applied to train and test data, training is much faster (3 minutes)
